		If the engine is given a position to search that is in the tablebases, it will use the tablebases at the beginning of the search to preselect all good moves, i.e. all moves that preserve the win or preserve the draw while taking into account the 50-move rule. It will then perform a search only on those moves. The engine will not move immediately, unless there is only a single good move. The engine likely will not report a mate score, even if the position is known to be won.

	// 	A value of 1, implied a 1 pawn advantage. However, with engines being so strong, and the NNUE evaluation being much less tied to material value, a new scheme was needed.
	// 	The new normalized evaluation is now linked to the probability of winning, with a 1.0 pawn advantage being a 0.5 (that is 50%) win probability.
	// 	An evaluation of 0.0 means equal chances for a win or a loss, but also nearly 100% chance of a draw.`,
